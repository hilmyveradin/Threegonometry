                     Congratulations, you've learned three interesting things about essential trigonometric functions, Cartesian quadrants, and trigonometric graph representation!
                     
                     I hope you learned many things, and more importantly, had fun learning math.
                     
                     This playground is inspired after I taught my little brother high school trigonometry. We had a great time, and hopefully, you did too ðŸ˜Š
